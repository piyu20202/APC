PAYPAL MOBILE APP INTEGRATION - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================
Project: APC Ecommerce Flutter App
Integration: PayPal Mobile SDK (Flutter)

================================================================================
1. PAYPAL CREDENTIALS (MUST HAVE)
================================================================================

Required from Client:
- PayPal Client ID (Sandbox) - [Required for testing]
- PayPal Client ID (Production) - [Required for live app]
- PayPal Environment: Sandbox/Production

Where to get:
- Client needs PayPal Business Account
- Get from PayPal Developer Dashboard: https://developer.paypal.com

================================================================================
2. BACKEND API ENDPOINT (MUST HAVE)
================================================================================

Required Backend Endpoint:
- Endpoint: /user/payment/paypal/process (or similar)
- Method: POST
- What it should accept:
  * order_id or order_number
  * payment_token (from PayPal SDK)
  * amount
  * currency
  * user email

- What it should return:
  * success: true/false
  * order: { order details }
  * payment_status: completed/pending/failed

Note: Similar to existing Apple Pay and Google Pay endpoints

================================================================================
3. PAYPAL CONFIGURATION (MUST HAVE)
================================================================================

Configuration Details:
- Currency: AUD (Australian Dollar) - [Confirm]
- Country: Australia - [Confirm]
- Business Name: [For display in PayPal checkout]

================================================================================
4. TESTING ACCOUNTS (FOR TESTING)
================================================================================

For Testing:
- PayPal Sandbox Test Account (Buyer) - [For testing payments]
- Or test credit card numbers - [If available]

================================================================================
5. INTEGRATION APPROACH (CONFIRMATION)
================================================================================

Integration Method:
- PayPal Checkout SDK (Web-based) - Recommended for Flutter
- OR PayPal Native SDK - If available for Flutter

Confirm with Client:
- Which method does backend support?
- Should we follow same pattern as Apple Pay/Google Pay?

================================================================================
SUMMARY - ONLY 3 THINGS CLIENT MUST PROVIDE
================================================================================

1. PayPal Client ID (Sandbox + Production)
2. Backend API Endpoint URL for PayPal payment processing
3. Currency and Country confirmation (AUD, Australia)

That's it! Rest we can handle in mobile app code.

================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO ASK CLIENT
================================================================================

1. Do you have PayPal Business Account? (Yes/No)
2. Can you provide PayPal Client ID? (Sandbox + Production)
3. Will backend team create PayPal payment endpoint? (Similar to Apple Pay endpoint)
4. When will backend endpoint be ready?
5. Currency is AUD, correct?

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Webhook is backend responsibility, not needed for mobile app
- Business details are for PayPal account setup (client's responsibility)
- Mobile app only needs Client ID and backend endpoint
- We'll handle SDK integration, UI, and payment flow in Flutter code
